# Create a function which takes one positive integer as its input and returns its factorial.
# To make sure that your function works correctly, you should call it with the inputs 3, 4, and 5
# and print what is returned by those calls.  For those inputs, you should get 6, 24, and 120, respectively.

    for item in range(fac_num, 1, -1):
        returned *= item
